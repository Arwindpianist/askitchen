## üõ† How It Was Built

ASKitchen was carefully crafted with a focus on simplicity, performance, and easy content management:

- **Frontend**:  
  Built using **Next.js 14 App Router** with **TypeScript** for strong typing and **Tailwind CSS** for flexible, responsive design.

- **Backend & Database**:  
  **Supabase** (an open-source Firebase alternative) handles database storage and API access for recipes and subscriptions.

- **Authentication**:  
  Admin access is restricted to specific email addresses hardcoded into the environment settings, keeping things lightweight and avoiding the need for a full auth system.

- **Deployment**:  
  The site is deployed on **Vercel**, leveraging its fast global CDN for excellent load times and instant updates.
